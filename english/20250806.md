I'm no longer interested in learning web development. That said, CSS is still one of my favorite languages, and it's getting more powerful every day. So I want to keep up with its updates, but it's very tough to do so. I still follow newsletters and blogs by awesome people, but since I don't write CSS code for my projects anymore, I have no way to get familiar with these new features by my hand. Building small examples instead of real projects to try them out is not that fun to me.
