Healthy habits are so hard to form, but even if I succeed, they are too easy to break. Bad habits are just the opposite; they are easy to form and hard to break.

Healthy habits are so hard to develop. And even when I succeed, they are too easy to break. Bad habits are just the opposite; easy to form but hard to break.
