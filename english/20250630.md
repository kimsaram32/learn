Pause and think - [LLMs bring new nature of abstraction](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-nature-abstraction.html)

> Like most loudmouths in this field, I've been paying a lot of attention to the role that generative AI systems may play in software development.
- loudmouth
- role, play
- pay attention

> I think the appearance of LLMs will change software development to a similar degree as the change from assembler to the first high-level programming languages.
- to a similar degree as
- change from ~ to ~

> LLMs are making that degree of impact, but with the distinction that it isn't just raising the level of abstraction, but also forcing us to consider what it means to program with non-deterministic tools.
- that degree of impact - 평소에 the same degree of impact로 쓰이는 걸 봄 - formal 하다고 함
- with the distinction
- what it means to

> With assembler I'm thinking about the instruction set of a particular machine.
- thinking about - think about vs think of

> have to figure out how to do even simple actions by moving data into the right registers to invoke those specific actions.
- even simple actions를 those specific actions로 다시 받음
- moving ~ into

> HLLs meant I could now think in terms of sequences of statements, conditionals to choose between alternatives, and iteration to repeatedly apply statements to collections of data values.
- can 아니라 could?
- in terms of
