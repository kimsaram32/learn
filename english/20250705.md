Today I read a very small part of a book about computer networks, and there I learned what exactly is the Internet. Before that, I could say I kind of know what it is, but couldn't explain the nature of it. But now, that one section of the book satisfied my curiosity. After all the endless rabbit hole of searching the right source of truth, I finally got the answer I wanted. When I got the feeling of discovering something new, the sheer amount of joy was incomparable to instant gratification.
And I love it. This is why I learn new things.

Today I read a small part of a book about computer networks, and there I learned what exactly the Internet is. Before that, I could say I kind of knew what it was, but couldn't explain how it actually worked. But now, that one section of the book satisfied my curiosity. After going down an endless rabbit hole trying to reach the right source of truth, I finally got the answer I was looking for. The feeling of discovering something new is much more enjoyable than any other instant gratification I get from the Internet.
And I love it. This is why I learn new things.
