# 20250805

Being disciplined alone is not enough to change my behaviors. I am prohibited to access many parts of my brain. Changing them manually is impossible with my willpower. Human consciousness is impossible to do that. Instead, it's good at long-term planning and allocating resources for other "modules". As an administrator, it's not my job to explicitly telling them what tasks to do. Instead, I can dictate their objectives and directions.

> change my behaviors
- behaviors -> actions

> prohibited to access
- -> unable to access
- prohibited + to부정사는 틀린 표현
- 좀 더 informal 한 단어를 원했다

> Human consciousness is impossible to do that
- It's impossible for human consciousness to do that
- 가주어로 빼기

> to explicitly telling them
- -> to explicitly tell them
- grammatically incorrect
