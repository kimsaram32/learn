The last Java version I configured with jenv was 23, and I wanted to install version 21 alongside it.
I haven't touched Java and its related tools since that time though, so I had to learn all of them again.

jenv manages different versions of Java, but it does not install them automatically; I need to do that by myself. So I first installed OpenJDK 21 with brew:
```shell
brew install openjdk@21
```

Then I added the installed version to jenv. Before that, I created a symbolic link to integrate with the `java_home` tool, which returns the Java home directory for a particular version.
```shell
sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-21.jdk
jenv add "$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v21)"
```

And that's it! Now whenever I need to use Java 21 in my project, I simply have to run:
```shell
jenv local 21
```

or to set the global Java version:
```
jenv global 21
```

`jenv` does exactly what it's supposed to do: switching between different Java versions. I think it's pretty nice.
