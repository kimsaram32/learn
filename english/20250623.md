Senior developers use AI because they don't want to tackle with simple, everyday tasks. But juniors use AI because they can't deal with these tasks by themselves. These are not simple nor easy to them.

> tackle with
- tackle은 with와 쓰지 않음
- tackle의 뉘앙스는 이 상황이랑은 잘 맞지 않는다 → bother with, deal with, handle 등으로

> juniors
- 앞에서 senior developers을 사용했으니 일관성을 위해 junior developers로 바꾸면 더 자연스럽다

> These are not simple nor easy to them
- not A or B / neither A nor B 중에 하나만 해라
- to them → for them
- 앞 문장과 톤이 다르고 연결이 끊어지는 느낌 -- GPT는 "What's simple for seniors..." 로 paraphrase 함

Senior developers use AI because they don't want to bother with simple, everyday tasks. But junior developers use AI because they can't deal with these tasks by themselves. What's simple for seniors is neither simple nor easy for juniors.

AI isn't going to replace software developers. It will never do. But they are preventing juniors from going further.

> AI isn't ... they are ~
- 앞에서 isn't로 언급했는데 왜 뒤에선 they are로 받는건지,,

> It will never do.
- It will never do보다는 It never will 또는 It will never happen
- 앞 문장과 em dash로 연결해도 좋다

> going further
- 개발 맥락에서는 advancing, growing 등이 더 자연스럽다

AI isn't going to replace software developers—it never will. But it is preventing juniors from growing.
