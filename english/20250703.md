Generic code usually refers to a programming style where a single declaration can be used with different types. This type of code make your functions and types more flexible, and thus they become really reusable.
In Swift, the most go-to way to write generic code is using type parameters. Type parameters are like normal function parameters you use everyday. But instead of receiving concrete values of certain type, the function or type receives concrete types with some requirements.
Think of them like variables but with types as their values. You use them in your code like normal variable declarations. And when you call a generic function or create an instance of a generic type, the variable then gets certain concrete type for its value.

> This type of code make your functions and types more flexible, and thus they become really reusable.
- subject-verb agreement: make → makes
- type → kind
- 뒷문장이 어색함 → and therefore more reusable.

> The most go-to way
- go-to 약간 informal, 좀 안맞음 → common

> you use everyday
- every day가 맞음 [[every day vs everyday]]

> concrete type with some requirements
- with some requirements → that meet certain requirements (more idiomatic)

> And when you call a generic function or create an instance of a generic type
- And 굳이 있을 필요 없음,,

> the variable then gets certain concrete type for its value
- 전체적으로 어색함
- The variable is assigned a specific, concrete type

Generic code usually refers to a programming style where a single declaration can be used with different types. This kind of code makes your functions and types more flexible, and therefore more reusable.
In Swift, the most common way to write generic code is using type parameters. Type parameters are like normal function parameters you use every day. But instead of receiving concrete values of a certain type, the function or type receives concrete types that meet certain requirements.
