# 20250813

In kubernetes, the smallest unit of deployment is a Pod. Instead of manually deploying containers, you create pods with containers in them. This abstraction allows the separation of concerns between a deployable unit and the actual implementation of it.
However, Pods alone are not enough to be used in communication within or outside the cluster. Pods are designed to be easily disposable and thus they are unstable. Accessing Pods directly is unreliable because you can't guarantee they are alive.
Instead, you create services to expose them in a network. A Service abstracts Pods and takes incoming requests for them. Services have fixed IP addresses, so they are suited for logical hosts for a network.
