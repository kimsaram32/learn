## Writings

When Swift was first introduced as the new primary language for iOS development, developers still had to use ~~the old APIs in Objective-C~~. ==old Objective-C APIs==. No effective utilizations of the powerful protocol-oriented language design. No fancy usages of closures.

- fragment 잘 쓰려면 formal 한 단어 선택은 피해라 e.g utilizations
- No effective utilizations of ... → No real use of ...
- No fancy usages of closures → No clever closure tricks

One example was the legacy of Target-Action APIs. In order to attach UI event handlers to `UIView`s, we had to use awkward ad-hoc language syntaxes like `@objc` and `#selector()`.

> legacy of Target-Action APIs
- legacy 보통 adj → legacy Target-Action API

> awkward ad-hoc language syntaxes
- syntaxes 거의 안 쓰고 syntax
- [[ad-hoc]] - designing / architecture에 씀 → syntax에 붙기엔 안 맞음

> `@objc` and `#selector()`
- 병렬 구조가 자연스러우려면 동일한 범주의 문법 요소로 바꿔줘야 함
