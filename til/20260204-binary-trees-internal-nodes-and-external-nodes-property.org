* 20260204 - Relationship between internal nodes and external nodes in binary trees
A binary tree with \(N\) internal nodes has \(N + 1\) external nodes.

This can be proved by induction:

1. For \(N = 0\), BT is an external node, and therefore it has 0
   internal nodes and 1 external node. this satisfies the property.

2. For \(N > 0\),
   1. BT is an internal node whose left subtree has \(k\) (\(0 \le k \le N - 1\)) internal nodes and
      whose right subtree has \(N - 1 - k\) internal nodes.
   2. By the inductive hypothesis, the left subtree has \(k + 1\) external nodes and
      the right subtree has \(N - k\) internal nodes, for a total of \(N + 1\).
