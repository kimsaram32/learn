My Obsidian vault is becoming a chaotic mess, so I've been thinking of restructuring all of my current notes. But before that, I should know what methodologies there are for organizing them. Today I learned about Zettelkasten, a note-taking method for connecting my thoughts.
The main benefit of using Zettelkasten is an ever-growing connection of thoughts. I feel like my current "thought notes" are all outdated and hard to re-read. Zettelkasten is all about linking my notes, so I can review my thoughts and develop them further.
