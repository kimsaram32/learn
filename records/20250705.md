If you work *in* digital accessibility, you've probably seen the *full spectrum of* accessibility statements.
- work *in*
- **full spectrum of ~**

These *range from* non-existent *to* misleading *to* well-written and accurate.
- **range from ... to ... to** - to 가 두번 쓰였다

They may look similar *on the surface*, but the intent and effort behind them can vary dramatically.

When a site has no accessibility statement, it usually means one of three things:
- one of the three things 인 줄 알았는데 the가 없다

Without a statement, users have no information *on* what barriers to expect, whether feedback is welcome, or how to report issues.
- information *on*

We are *committed to making* our website accessible to everyone.
- commited to -ing

*From the perspective of* the disabled user, there is no connection between the statement and the site’s experience
- from the perspective of ~
- between ... and ...
