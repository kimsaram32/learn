I've been using Obsidian for nearly 2 years, and I've never considered leaving it. Recently, however, I started to feel that maybe I don't need Obsidian anymore. I've been really into terminal-based daily workflow these days, and once I go through it, I think I'll abandon Obsidian. But I haven't set up my terminal to be comfortable enough to fully switch to it. For now, I'm still with Obsidian.

I've been using Obsidian for nearly two years and have never considered leaving it. Recently, though, I've started to feel that maybe I don't need Obsidian anymore. Lately, I've been really into a terminal-based daily workflow, and once I've fully set it up, I think I'll move away from Obsidian. But I haven't set up my terminal environment to be comfortable enough to switch. For now, I'm still with Obsidian.
