Pause and think - Balancing Long-Term Improvement with Short-Term Happiness

There’s an age-old dilemma when it comes to trying to improve your life: how do you focus on the long-term goal while also enjoying life right now?
- when it comes to ~~ - -ing 형태가 뒤에 붙었다
- while also - also while 하면 이상하다

It can often feel like a trade-off — I should go to the gym (or study, write, work on that hard project, etc.) … but I also want to relax, veg out while watching TV, eat donuts, play video games, etc.
- can often - often can 아님
- work *on* that hard project

Should I enjoy myself now, or do what’s good for my future? Should I work hard and then get the reward, or forget about the hard stuff and just enjoy this moment?
- Shoud I ~~ or ~~ 구조 반복
- forget *about*

For me, there is no right answer … but I learned a “trick” that helps me combine the two approaches into one.
- combine ~~ into one

Here’s how it works:

\1. I figure out what will make me happiest in the long-run — what is the life that I really want?
- in the long run

\2. Then I figure out what I can do today to make that happen. What steps can I do repeatedly to build the life I want?
- make that happen
- repeatedly 내가 쓸 때는 생각이 안남
- the life I want - 앞에 사용된 the life that I really want와 비슷하지만 어색하지 않음 - 단어를 줄여서?

\3. Then I find a way to love the hell out of that activity.
- the hell out of

Let’s dive into these things to really put them into action in our lives.
- dive into ~~
- put ~~ into action
