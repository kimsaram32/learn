Human beings aren't capable of remembering things forever, and I find it really painful. Even if I learn new technologies and read many articles on one day, I feel like I can't even recall half of them. Spaced repetition is helping me overcoming this but it's not enough.
I need to embrace my brain's limit and let some of my knowledge go.

Human beings aren't capable of remembering things forever, and I find it really frustrating. Even if I learn new technologies and read many articles in one day, I can barely remember half of it. Spaced repetition is helping me overcome this, but it's still not enough.

- unnatural

> Spaced repetition is helping me overcome this
- unnatural, wordy

> let some of my knowledge go
- understandable, but slightly awkward

Human beings aren't capable of retaining everything they learned, and I find it really frustrating. Even if I learn new technologies and read many articles in one day, I can barely remember half of it. Spaced repetition is helping me, but it's still not enough.
I need to embrace my brain's limitations and accept that some knowledge will fade.
