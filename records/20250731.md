When I first started building my Zettelkasten, I wanted my Zettels to be highly linked so that I can discover them easier. And over time, this mindset changed into something different: suddenly I wanted them to be completely managed. But I've learned that it's considered a bad practice. Zettelkasten is all about embracing its chaotic structure.

When I first started building my Zettelkasten, I wanted my Zettels to be highly linked so that I could discover them more easily. Over time, though, my mindset shifted: I began wanting them to be completely managed. But I've learned that it's considered a bad practice. Zettelkasten is all about embracing its chaotic structure.
