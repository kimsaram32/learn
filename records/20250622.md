I just sat down to learn new things, discover new technologies, and build some stuff. But then I just entered Reddit. Then I just spent 2 hours doing nothing but doomscrolling through an infinite rabbit hole full of useless but fun memes. I literally wasted my time.
I regret it. I could have done better than this.
Why things always end up here? Why I keep going the wrong way and then regretting it?
