I wanted to learn Kubernetes core concepts, so I read through its documentation. But I immediately got overwhelmed by its unfamilar architecture. The terminology and concepts didn't just stick to me. Maybe it's just because this is the first time I learned about infrastructure stuff. Hopefully I will figure things out.

> didn't just stick to me
- → just didn't stick with me
- non-native하게 들린다
- *resonate with me*
- *sink in*

> this is the first time I learned about infrastructure stuff
- → this is my first time learning about infrastructure
- slightly awkward phrasing
